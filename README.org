#+TITLE: FunTask - Functional Programming with Tasks

FunTask is a typed, functional command language and interpreter, intended as an
alternative to contemporary, textual shells.

FunTask draws on ideas from functional programming, to provide a cleaner
programming experience, while retaining a natural command-line interface,
similar to established, imperative shells.
