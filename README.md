# FunTask

FunTask is a typed, functional command language and interpreter, intended as an
alternative to contemporary, textual "shells". FunTask draws on ideas from
functional programming, to provide a cleaner programming experience, while
retaining a "natural" command interface, similar to established, imperative
shells.
