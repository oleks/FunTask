# FunTask

FunTask is a typed, functional command language and interpreter, intended as an
alternative to contemporary, textual "shells". FunTask draws on ideas from
functional programming, to provide a cleaner programming interface, while
retaining ideas from established, imperative shells, in order to maintain a
"natural" interface.
